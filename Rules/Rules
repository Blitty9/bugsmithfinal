# Coding pattern preferences

– Always prefer simple solutions  
– Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality  
– Write code that takes into account the different environments: dev, test, and prod  
– You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested  
– When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we don’t have duplicate logic.  
– Keep the codebase very clean and organized  
– Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, especially if the script is likely only to be run once  
– Avoid having files over 200–300 lines of code. Refactor at that point.  
– Mocking data is only needed for tests, never mock data for dev or prod  
– Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code that affects the dev or prod environments  
– Never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirming

# AI Memory Rule

This rule defines how the AI should manage and utilize its "memory" regarding this specific project, including user preferences, learned facts, and project-specific conventions.

## Purpose

The AI's memory helps maintain consistency and adapt to specific project needs or user preferences discovered during interactions. It prevents the AI from repeatedly asking for the same information or making suggestions contrary to established patterns.

## Storage

All learned project-specific knowledge and preferences should be stored and referenced in the `learned-memories.mdc` file located in `.cursor/rules`.

## Updating Memory

When new information relevant to the project's conventions, user preferences, or specific technical details is learned (either explicitly told by the user or inferred through conversation), the AI should:

1.  **Identify Key Information:** Determine the core piece of knowledge to be stored.
2.  **Check Existing Memory:** Review `learned-memories.mdc` to see if this information contradicts or updates existing entries.
3.  **Propose Update:** Suggest an edit to `learned-memories.mdc` to add or modify the relevant information. Keep entries concise and clear.

## Using Memory

Before proposing solutions, code changes, or answering questions, the AI should consult `learned-memories.mdc` to ensure its response aligns with the recorded knowledge and preferences.

## Example Scenario

**User:** "We've decided to use Tailwind v4 for this project, not v3."

**AI Action:**

1.  Recognize this as a project-specific technical decision.
2.  Check `learned-memories.mdc` for existing Tailwind version information.
3.  Propose adding or updating an entry in `learned-memories.mdc`:
    ```markdown
    ## Technical Decisions

    *   **CSS Framework:** Tailwind v4 is used. Ensure usage aligns with v4 documentation and practices, noting differences from v3.
    ```
4.  In subsequent interactions involving Tailwind, the AI will refer to this entry and consult v4 documentation if necessary.

## Memory File (`.cursor/rules/learned-memories.mdc`)

The basic structure:

```markdown
# Project Memory

This file stores project-specific knowledge, conventions, and user preferences learned by the AI assistant.

## User Preferences

-   [Preference 1]
-   [Preference 2]

## Technical Decisions

-   [Decision 1]
-   [Decision 2]

## Project Conventions

-   [Convention 1]
-   [Convention 2]
```

<frontend_aesthetics>
You tend to converge toward generic, "on distribution" outputs. In frontend design,this creates what users call the "AI slop" aesthetic. Avoid this: make creative,distinctive frontends that surprise and delight. 

Focus on:
- Typography: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics.
- Color & Theme: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Draw from IDE themes and cultural aesthetics for inspiration.
- Motion: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.
- Backgrounds: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Layer CSS gradients, use geometric patterns, or add contextual effects that match the overall aesthetic.

Avoid generic AI-generated aesthetics:
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Clichéd color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. You still tend to converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations. Avoid this: it is critical that you think outside the box!
